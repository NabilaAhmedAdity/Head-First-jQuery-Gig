# jump for Joy

Here I have completed the following tasks:

- The page has a header. 
- The page has other four sections with a image per section. 
- The sections are clickable. 
- Highlight the box on which the mouse is placed.
- When a user clicks on one of the sections, a message "Your Discount is" appears below the image of that section.
- The doiscount should only be in one of the four boxes, the box can be changed after loading.
- Visitors should only get one chance to find the discount when they load the page. So it will not be allowed to click more than once.
- After thr visitor has made his guess and clicked on a abox, the answer should be reveled as to whether or not he got it right.
