# jump for Joy

Here I have completed the following tasks:

- The page has a header. 
- The page has other four sections with a image per section. 
- The sections are clickable. 
- When a user clicks on one of the sections, a message "Your Discount is" appears below the image of that section.
- If a user clicks again, get rid of the last message and make a new one.
